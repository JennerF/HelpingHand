NEXT TIME
- Decide how to store activities data (is there a way for FB to store or do I use parse?)
- Decide on features for messaging/tasks/ratings








What needs to get done:
- Plan out how the main page will work
- Figure out which FB features are needed
- Test to make sure FB connect works
- Plan out remaining features
